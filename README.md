This homework will provide you with more practice creating abstract classes, subclasses, and interfaces.

You'll need to design a program that manages a school. The school has classrooms, and the classrooms have teachers and students assigned to them. Each classroom contains students in a single grade (i.e., first, second, third, and so on).

You decide what the actions and properties of each class will be.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- At least one abstract class.
- At least one interface.
- At least three subclasses.
- Each subclass must be unique from the others.

**Bonus**: Add extra classes, subclasses, or interfaces.

#### Deliverable

Java code for classes or interfaces that meet the requirements above.
